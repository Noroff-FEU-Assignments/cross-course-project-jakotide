    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      The first thing I would recommend my client to do is to educate everyone
      involved in the web development process about security. This is called the
      secdevops practice and it is a much more viable and safer option than
      having one small specialized team have all the responsibility for securing
      the website. Having a specialized security team is also good, but better
      in a combination with everyone. Make sure everyone is aware of different
      security threats like SQL injections and cross-site scripting. Teach the
      developers how to write secure code and have everyone share responsibility
      for securing the website. Then I would advise to have an emergency plan
      ready if a cyberattack occurs. Classify a range of cyberattacks and have a
      list of actions to do for each one of them. This is called a cybersecurity
      framework. Also regularly have security audits to identify potential
      security loopholes. I would also recommend that they encrypt all their
      data. This can be done using TLS/SSL, Transport layer security and secure
      socket layer. This will encrypt the data in transit between the client's
      browser and server, making sure the data is safe from attacks and
      sensitive information reaches its intended recipient. Then I would tell
      them to get a web application firewall (WAF). This will provide them with
      real-time security monitoring which will help block cyberattack threats
      24/7. Attacks like sql injections or bot's trying to DDOS the website.
      Tell them to hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst!
